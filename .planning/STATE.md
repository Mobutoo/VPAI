### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 phases derived from 7 requirement categories compressed to quick depth
- Roadmap: OpenClaw upgrade (Phase 2) before agent integration (Phase 3) — plane-bridge needs v2026.2.26
- Roadmap: Provisioning (workspace, tokens, custom fields) bundled into Phase 1 with infra

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Plane Docker image version not yet identified — need to research latest stable self-hosted release
- VPS 8GB RAM shared across 20+ services — Plane resource limits (512MB total) may be tight
